These courses allowed me to further specialise in (Bayesian) psychometrics, the use of machine learning, and working with realistic datasets resembling real-life scenarios.\n### Master's Thesis \nFor my Masters' thesis, I am evaluating the impact of test motivation on PISA and TIMSS Outcomes, where test motivation is measured by missing answers to questions and response times. PISA and TIMSS are both Internal Large-Scale Assessment studies (ILSAs).\n\n## Bachelor\nI have previously completed my Bachelors in Psychology at the University of Twente. Alongside the standard programme, I followed the elective modules Psychology of Safety, and Human factors & Engineering Psychology, as well as completed a minor abroad in Madrid. \\\\\n- The _Bachelor Psychology_ provided me with the basic psychology facts and thought processes helpful in both everyday life as well as for academic purposes.\\\\\n- The module _Psychology of Safety_ taught me how to influence individual responses to risks and safety issues, such as proper crowd control when disasters occur. \\\\\n- _Human factors & Engineering Psychology_ offered great insight into how one can implement psychological findings into designing websites, daily user objects, apps, or even cars.  As a part of this module, I completed a project programming an eye-tracking device using Python, a ruler, and a cheap camera. \\\\ \n- The minor was focused on companies, their structures and their management.\n### Thesis \nMy Bachelor thesis focused on the statistical analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) trial data through _Bayesian covariance structure modelling (BCSM)_. I conducted a simulation study for the evaluation of the BCSM compared to a linear mixed effects model for different sample sizes and covariance values. The BCSM was then applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) trial data. \n\n# Work Experience\nI have individually taught several practicals at the University of Utrecht in the subject Kennismaking met onderzoeksmethoden en statistiek, or KOM for short. This course aims to introduce first year students to qualitative, correlational and experimental research.
