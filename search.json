You can find the official programme page here\\ For my electives, I chose courses at Cito, where I studied: Contemporary Datasets, Psychometrics and Data Science, and Bayesian Psychometrics. These courses allowed me to further specialise in (Bayesian) psychometrics, the use of machine learning, and working with realistic datasets resembling real-life scenarios. ### Master’s Thesis For my Masters’ thesis, I am evaluating the impact of test motivation on PISA and TIMSS Outcomes, where test motivation is measured by missing answers to questions and response times. PISA and TIMSS are both Internal Large-Scale Assessment studies (ILSAs)."

As a part of this module, I completed a project programming an eye-tracking device using Python, a ruler, and a cheap camera. \\ - The minor was focused on companies, their structures and their management. ### Thesis My Bachelor thesis focused on the statistical analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) trial data through Bayesian covariance structure modelling (BCSM). I conducted a simulation study for the evaluation of the BCSM compared to a linear mixed effects model for different sample sizes and covariance values. The BCSM was then applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) trial data."
